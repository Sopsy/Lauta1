# The old board software from Ylilauta.org
The code was rewritten from scratch, as this one had become too hard to maintain due to bad design.
The current code of Ylilauta which has been used since December 2020 does not resemble this one at all.

But this software served its purpose and did it very well. It was fast and relatively bug-free.

This old code is now released under the MIT license, so you are mostly free to do anything you want with this.

Some files have been removed to avoid licensing issues, so you might need to obtain or otherwise replace them if you want to try the software out:
- static/css/pure.css (Pure v0.5.0 by Yahoo!)
- static/css/icons.css, static/fonts/icomoon.woff2, TVGuide/static/css/scss/_icons.scss TVGuide/static/css/fonts/* (Custom Icomoon icon font)
- data/ip2location-db/* (IP2Location databases)
- static/img/*, TVGuide/static/img/* (Some images that can't be distributed)
- static/img/logo/*, TVGuide/static/img/* (Logo of Ylilauta and variations, still copyrighted)
